<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Getting Information and all the resource related to Google Developer Student Club IPS Academy and all the Events, Hackathons, etc. that we conduct gets complicated as Information and resources are divided on multiple platforms such as the DSC Community Website, WhatsApp Group of GDSC IPS Academy, GitHub Org of GDSC IPSA and so on. Specific Technologies can be used to Implement a solution to ease the process and concentrate all the Information related to GDSC PHCET on a single platform.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

This project proposes a "Community Android Application" to accumulate all the Information and Resources related to our developer community here at GDSC PHCET in one single Android Application, which will make it a one-stop destination for all community members to access all the resources from one single platform rather than searching over all our social media handles and web-pages.
